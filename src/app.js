Although GoDaddy makes great effort to maximize the lifespan of all its Services and features, functionalities, or aspects of the Services, there are times when a Service or specific feature, functionality, or aspect of a Service that we offer will be discontinued or reach its End-of-Life ("EOL"). If that is the case, those Services, or the specific feature, functionality, or aspect of that Service, will no longer be supported by GoDaddy, in any way, effective on the EOL date.
