          The evidence highlights that HAT is associated with large reductions
          in the volume of offences, the crime severity score and associated
          costs to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)iv, with approximate savings of
          Â£97,800. Importantly, costs do not include those past sentencing i.e.
          prison or probation so the cost savings associated with a reduction of
          the volume and severity of offences is likely far greater than this
          figure. Therefore, individuals who engage with HAT not only commit
          less offences, but the offences that they do commit are less serious
          than the year preceding HAT. The rate of offending per person reduced
          from three crimes per participant to 1.2 crimes per participant. This
          reduction in offending is corroborated in the TOPs self-report data
          set, where 9 out of 14 individuals reported shoplifting every day in
          the previous 28 day period on entry to the pilot, which reduced to 0
          days by month 1 for majority of these individuals (6 out of 9).
