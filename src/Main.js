          The only harmful recession is an accelerating inflation rate of
          marginal unemployment, I say. Otherwise, a recession is either the
          opposite of shrinkflation or a normal trade-off. I also don’t think
          exchanging durable goods for currency is a decent trade. Should I even
          try to apply? I have an economics minor from JHU in the U.S. but am

            The evidence highlights that HAT is associated with large reductions
            in the volume of offences, the crime severity score and associated
            costs to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ)iv, with approximate savings
            of £97,800. Importantly, costs do not include those past sentencing
            i.e. prison or probation so the cost savings associated with a
            reduction of the volume and severity of offences is likely far
            greater than this figure. Therefore, individuals who engage with HAT
            not only commit less offences, but the offences that they do commit
            are less serious than the year preceding HAT. The rate of offending
            per person reduced from three crimes per participant to 1.2 crimes
            per participant. This reduction in offending is corroborated in the
            TOPs self-report data set, where 9 out of 14 individuals reported
            shoplifting every day in the previous 28 day period on entry to the
            pilot, which reduced to 0 days by month 1 for majority of these
            individuals (6 out of 9).
